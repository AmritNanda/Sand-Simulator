# Falling Sand Simulation

A simple particle simulation built with Python and `pygame-ce`, where different materials like sand and rock fall and interact under gravity.

## 🚀 Features

- 🟡 Sand particles that fall and stack
- 🪨 Rock particles that behave differently
- 🧽 Eraser mode to remove particles
- ⌨️ Keyboard + mouse controls
- 🖼️ Grid-based simulation window

##  Controls

| Action           | Key / Mouse             |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Switch to Sand   | `S`                     |
| Switch to Rock   | `R`                     |
| Erase particles  | `E`                     |
| Clear screen     | `Space`                 |
| Place particle   | Left Mouse Click        |
| Quit             | Window Close Button     |

## Particle Types

- **Sand**: Falls under gravity and stacks naturally
- **Rock**: Behaves like a solid, doesn't fall like sand
- **Eraser**: Removes particles from the grid

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce)
